What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder to track the meta data for changes in repository. If we have to use a git repository, we should initialize it first.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is intermediate between directory and repository. we may not want to track all files in directory. Files that we want to track are added to staging area. We can also add changes to the staging area.
Only what is staged will be commited. It gives us freedom to choose what changes/files to be commited

git diff
git diff --staged
git reset --hard

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If you have made more than on logical change (on different files) add only one file to the staging area at a time and do commits seperately.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

helps us to try new changes or add features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

git merge branch1 branch2
git branch -d
git show commitid

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

if there is a conflict in the branch, open the conflict, resolve it, stage and commit.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

pros: manually merging could take a lot of effort. Especially if there are several files.
cons: if instead of addition, some code is replaced, then conflict happens and we have to do manually. Also even after merging ,we might need to review for bugs.
